For the database for the Aves project, we will use PostgresSQL. The eBird dataset is from Cornell Lab of Ornithology and obtained through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The air quality data was obtained from the United States Environmental Protection Agency. I initially began with ten years of observation eBird data for California but the data file was over 47 million rows and too large for my processing power. After considering which birds that are native to California and may be more susceptible to air quality factors, I requested datasets for the 14 observed species of hummingbirds in California for the last ten years. This dataset produced over 1.3 million rows. For the ETL process, we will use Jupyter Notebook, Python and Pandas to merge the data sets and clean them. SQLAlchemy will be used to load the data into the PostgresSQL database.
