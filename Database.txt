For the database for the Aves project, we will use PostgresSQL. The temperature data, downloaded from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will come from a .csv file and will be uploaded directly into the database. The ebirds, from Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and air quality data, from the Environmental Protection Agency, are coming from API calls. For the ETL process, we will use Jupyter Notebook and Python to call the data and clean it and then the Pandas and SQLAlchemy to load the data into the PostgresSQL database.
