## Project Background

We used 11 years of data pertaining to population, weather events, air quality index, and eBird observations of 10 hummingbird species throughout the state of California. The data was cleaned using Python and the Pandas library. Once the data was cleaned, it was put into a SQL database, using PostgreSQL/pgAdmin.

## Question(s)

Does air quality impact hummingbird populations in California?

Is there a relationship between air quality and hummingbird species distribution and resilience throughout California?

Does poor air quality have an impact on resources hummingbirds rely on for survival?

Do microclimates throughout California impact the fitness of hummingbird habitats at different times of the year?

____

## Resources and Tools

eBird and Air Quality data was obtained from APIs.

California weather data was obtained from a CSV.

Jupyter Notebook was used for writing code.

pgAdmin and PostgreSQL were used for creating the database.

Any further changes and additions will be listed as they are used.

## Communication

Our team will meet at least twice a week on Monday and Wednesday during class time via Zoom. We will likely also have a short meeting via Slack or Zoom each Sunday to ensure all required fields have been met for each Segment Due Date.

## Distribution of Tasks

Sierra- GitHub Repository & Presentation Slides

- GitHub: Maintain repository and ensure all information needed is included, accessable, and functional.

- Presentation Slide Deck: Add content that follows the rubric outline, making sure all requirements are met. Use Google Slides . Include information listed on rubric.


Cristina- Machine Learning
Type of Machine Learning: Supervised machine learning because we are classifying our results to see which bird species is present given the features.
Model: After running different models the best accuracy scores came from the Decision Tree model.
