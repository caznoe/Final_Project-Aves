Analyzing eBird and air quality data in California.

## Communication

Our team will meet at least twice a week on Monday and Wednesday during class time via Zoom. We will likely also have a short meeting via Slack or Zoom each Sunday to ensure all required fields have been met for each Segment Due Date.

## Project Background

We are using 10 years of data for analysis in our machine model. We are using weather data, eBird data-sepecifically for Owls or Woodpeckers, and air quality data for the state of California. The data will be cleaned so we can use monthly averages for our datasets/analysis.

## Resources and Tools

eBird and Air Quality data will be obtained from APIs.

California weather data will be obtained from a CSV.

We we will Jupyter Notebooks for writing our code.

Postgres will be used for the database.

Any further changes and additions will be listed as they are used.
