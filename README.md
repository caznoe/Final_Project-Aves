## Project Background

We used 11 years of data pertaining to population, weather events, air quality index, and eBird observations of 10 hummingbird species throughout the state of California. The data was cleaned using Python and the Pandas library. Once the data was cleaned, it was put into a SQL database, using PostgreSQL/pgAdmin.

## Question(s)

Does air quality impact hummingbird populations in California?

Is there a relationship between air quality and hummingbird species distribution and resilience throughout California?

Does poor air quality have an impact on resources hummingbirds rely on for survival?

Do microclimates throughout California impact the fitness of hummingbird habitats at different times of the year?

## Resources and Tools

eBird and Air Quality data was obtained from APIs.

California weather data was obtained from a CSV.

Jupyter Notebook was used for writing code.

pgAdmin and PostgreSQL were used for creating the database.

Any further changes and additions will be listed as they are used.
