# Final_Project-Aves

Analyzing the relationship in eBird observations and air quality data in California.

## Communication

Our team will meet at least twice a week on Monday and Wednesday during class time via Zoom. We will likely also have a short meeting via Slack or Zoom each Sunday to ensure all required fields have been met for each Segment Due Date.

## Roles

Sierra- Square (GitHub Repository, Presentation, Dashboard Blueprint (Tableau)

- GitHub: Maintain repository and ensure all information needed is included, accessable, and functional.

- Presentation Slide Deck: Create draft for presentation in Google Slides. Include information listed on rubric.

- Dashboard: Will be using Tableau for our Dashboard, but have not yet made the mock-up/blueprint.

## Project Background

We are using 11 years of data for analysis in our machine model. We are using weather data, eBird observation data for 14 Hummingbird species and air quality data for the state of California. The data will be cleaned so we can use monthly averages for our datasets/analysis.

## Question(s)

Does air quality impact non-migratory bird populations in California?

Is there a relationship between air quality and Hummingbird species distribution  and resiliance throughout California?

Does poor air quality have an impact on resources Hummingbirds rely on for survival?

Do the microclimates throughout California imact the fittness of Hummingbird habitats at differnt times of the year?

## Resources and Tools

eBird and Air Quality data will be obtained from APIs.

California weather data will be obtained from a CSV.

We we will Jupyter Notebooks for writing our code.

pgAdmin and Postgres will be used for the database.

Any further changes and additions will be listed as they are used.
