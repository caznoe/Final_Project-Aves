## Sourcing Data
- Gathered csv data files for bird observations from Cornell Lab of Ornithology and obtained through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. 
- Deciding the scope of the data. The initial bird observation in California file was over 47 mil rows. 
  After considering which birds that are native to California and may be more susceptible to air quality factors, 
  I requested datasets for the 14 observed species of hummingbirds in California for the last ten years. This dataset 
  produced over 1.3 million rows. 
- The air quality data was taken from pre-generated daily reports from the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
- Weather event data was gathered from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
- County population data was gathered from the California Association of Counties.
- Our bird observation data was based on a geographic location and the remaining data was based on counties in California. In order to join, an API 
    call on the Federal Communications Commission was done to gather the county name based on location. Over 93,000 locations were run through the API one
    at a time.
